                    Implement Welcome E-mail Feature with Nodemailer
                    
                    Automatically send a welcome e-mail with HTML content, including the company's brand logo, to users upon successful registration.

2. Description:
                    Implement an automatic welcome e-mail feature that uses Nodemailer to send HTML-based e-mails to users.

                    The e-mail should include the company's brand logo and serve as a warm welcome to new registrants. Consult the image below for context.

                    Ensure that only one registration with a unique email address is allowed and provide clear error messages.

4. Description:
# To enhance user registration, ensure that each email address is unique. Handle duplicate key errors gracefully by providing clear and user-friendly error messages when a user attempts to register with an already registered email.

# Output based on default scaffold:

# Use Mongoose Middleware for Password Hashing

# Automatically hash user passwords using bcrypt via Mongoose Middleware before saving user documents.


5. Description:
                    Implement a Mongoose pre-hook (Middleware) in the user schema. This pre-hook should automatically hash user passwords using bcrypt before saving user documents, enhancing user security. Implement Forget Password and Reset Feature
                    
                    Allow users to reset their passwords using a token-based approach with a time limit.

6. Description:
                    Implement a password forgot feature for users who have forgotten their passwords for which the 'resetUserPassword' method is given in the scaffold.
                    
                    Initially, verify the user's existence by their email address. We have provided static method 'getResetPasswordToken' in the user schema that uses 'crypto' (core module of Node.js, to generate a new token) to generate a new token and set a token expiry time.

7. NOTE:
                    Upon generating a token through the crypto library, hash it and save it in the 'resetPasswordToken' field within the user's document. Simultaneously, define a 10-minute expiration period for the generated token and store this information in the 'resetPasswordExpire' field.
                    
                    Utilize Nodemailer to send the token, to the user's email address. Users can reset their passwords within the specified time frame using the provided token. Consult the image below for context.

                    Output - https://files.codingninjas.in/picture4-32309.png

8. NOTE:
                    When a user submits a token for the purpose of resetting their password, the initial step is to hash this token. Subsequently, conduct a search within the user collection to identify which user's document contains a hashed token matching the provided token. If this operation occurs within the specified expiry time frame, proceed to update the password. However, if the token has expired, respond with a message indicating that the token has expired.
# The route responsible for password feature is: Forget password route

#The route responsible for password reset feature is:

# Reset Password route

                    Fix Bug in Securing Admin Routes
                    
                    Fix an issue in the 'authByUserRole("admin")' middleware to ensure that only users with 'admin' roles can access secured routes.

9. Description:
# Correct an existing issue in the 'authByUserRole("admin")' middleware.

# The issue allows users with roles other than 'admin' to access routes intended only for admin users.

# Ensure that only users with 'admin' roles can access these secured routes.

                    Implement Route and Controller for Updating User Roles by Admin

                    Create a route and associated controllers to allow users with 'admin' roles to update the roles of other users.


10. Description:
                    Implement a new route, '/api/storefleet/user/admin/update/:id', and its associated controllers and repository functions.

# id: This represents the object identifier of the user whose role is intended to be modified by the administrator.

# The admin passes the new details of the user as shown in the Postman (refer to the provided Postman link for additional information).

                    Execute product filtering, search capabilities and pagination.
                    
                    Implementation of search, filtration, and pagination functionalities in adherence to specified criteria, ensuring efficient data retrieval and enhanced user experience.

11. Description:
                    The "getAllProducts" controller should incorporate the implementation of the following three features:

# Utilise the MongoDB regex operator (please refer to the documentation for details) to search for a specified keyword within a user document's name field in the user collection. If a match is found, the document should be retrieved.

# For pagination, the MongoDB "limit" method is to be used, and it's recommended to refer to the MongoDB documentation for more details.

12. Note:
                    For filtration, use your logic.
                    
                    Refer to the Postman link for route URLs.

                    Restrict users to deleting only their own reviews and update product ratings accordingly.

13. Description:
# Modify the review delete feature to allow users to delete only their reviews.

# When a user deletes a review, ensure the product's rating is accurately updated to reflect the change.
